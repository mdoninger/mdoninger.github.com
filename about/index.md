## Who?

My name is Manuel Doninger, and i'm currently working as a software architect.

## Why?
During my daily work, i often face some problems, where i hardly can find a solution (esp. in conjunction with WebSphere).
On this page i want to collect these problems and the appropriate solution for it.
The second purpose of this page is to provide a little sandbox for me to try out some web frameworks like jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap.

## How?
All articles are written in Markdown. The whole site is hosted at [Github Pages](http://github.com/mdoninger/mdoninger.github.com).
For easier writing i use Jekyll Bootstrap, which provides some nice extensions for Jekyll. The theme is based on Twitter Bootstrap
and the Bootswatch United color scheme.
