## Who?

My name is Manuel Doninger, and i'm currently working as a software developer at MARKANT Handels und Service GmbH, a
service company for the trade and industry.
I'm primarily working on some Java EE applications, administering IBM WebSphere, managing the whole development infrastructure
like version control systems (Git and CVS), build system (Jenkins) and coaching for other development teams on Maven, Git etc.

## Why?
During my daily work, i often face some problems, where i hardly can find a solution (esp. in conjunction with WebSphere).
On this page i want to collect these problems and the appropriate solution for it.
The second purpose of this page is to provide a little sandbox for me to try out some web frameworks like jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap.

## How?
All articles are written in Markdown. The whole site is hosted at [Github Pages](http://github.com/mdoninger/mdoninger.github.com).
For easier writing i use Jekyll Bootstrap, which provides some nice extensions for Jekyll. The theme is based on Twitter Bootstrap
and the Bootswatch United color scheme.

## Other questions
### Is this page a copy of [vogella.com](http://vogella.com)?
In case you wonder: No it isn't. But the great tutorials of Lars inspired me to create this site and share my knowledge.
I also won't publish any tutorials on my site, which he already has on his page, since i want to concentrate on other problems.
