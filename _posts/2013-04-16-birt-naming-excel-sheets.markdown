With the native Excel emitter for BIRT the sheets that are generated have a default name like "Report" or "Report1" etc.
You can rename the sheets by changing a page variable. This can be done in a script in BIRT.
Depending on the value, which you want to name the sheet, you have to choose the script of a certain element in your report
(i choose a row in a table, because i wanted to set the sheet name to a value which was only present in the rows of a report).
Then put the following command in that script:

{% highlight javascript %}
reportContext.setPageVariable("pageLabel","sheetname");
{% endhighlight %}

The first parameter is the variable name (every sheet is like a page for BIRT), and the second parameter is the actual sheet name.
